     * We could enforce other policies here, including that the length exactly

     * to the underlying sizeclass, so even malloc(0) will have a non-zero
     * length.  Monotonicity would then imply that the pointer must be the
     * head of an object (modulo, perhaps, temporal aliasing if we somehow
     * introduced phase shifts in heap layout like some allocators do).
     *
     * If we switched to bounding with upwards-rounded representable bounds
     * (c.f., CRRL) rather than underlying object size, then we should,
     * instead, in general require plausibility of p_raw by checking that its
     * length is nonzero and the snmalloc size class associated with its
     * length is the one for the slab in question... except for the added
     * challenge of malloc(0).  Since 0 rounds up to 0, we might end up
     * constructing zero-length caps to hand out, which we would then reject
     * upon receipt.  Instead, as part of introducing CRRL bounds, we should
     * introduce a sizeclass for slabs holding zero-size objects.  All told,
     * we would want to check that
     *
     *   size_to_sizeclass(length) == entry.get_sizeclass()
     *
     * I believe a relaxed CRRL test of
     *
     *   length > 0 || (length == sizeclass_to_size(entry.get_sizeclass()))
     *
     * would also suffice and may be slightly less expensive than the test
     * above, at the cost of not catching as many misbehaving clients.
     *
     * In either case, having bounded by CRRL bounds, we would need to be
     * *reconstructing* the capabilities headed to our free lists to be given
     * out to clients again; there are many more CRRL classes than snmalloc
     * sizeclasses (this is the same reason that we can always get away with
     * CSetBoundsExact in capptr_bound).  Switching to CRRL bounds, if that's
     * ever a thing we want to do, will be easier after we've done the
     * plumbing for CHERI+MTE.

    /*
     * TODO: Unsurprisingly, the CHERI+MTE case once again has something to
     * say here.  In that world, again, we are certain to be reconstructing
     * the capability for the free queue anyway, and so exactly what we wish
     * to enforce, length-wise, of the provided capability, is somewhat more
     * flexible.  Using the provided capability bounds when recoloring memory
     * could be a natural way to enforce that it covers the entire object, at
     * the cost of a more elaborate recovery story (as we risk aborting with a
     * partially recolored object).  On non-SNMALLOC_CHECK_CLIENT builds, it
     * likely makes sense to just enforce that length > 0 (*not* enforced by
     * the CAmoCDecVersion instruction) and say that any authority-bearing
     * interior pointer suffices to free the object.  I believe that to be an
     * acceptable security posture for the allocator and between clients;
     * misbehavior is confined to the misbehaving client.
