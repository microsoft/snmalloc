  /**
   * A FreeListMPSCQ is a chain of freed objects exposed as a MPSC append-only
   * atomic queue that uses one xchg per append.
   *
   * The internal pointers are considered QueuePtr-s to support deployment
   * scenarios in which the MPSCQ itself is exposed to the client.  This is
   * excessively paranoid in the common case that these metadata are as "hard"
   * for the client to reach as the Pagemap, which we trust to store not just
   * Tame CapPtr<>s but raw C++ pointers.
   *
   * Where necessary, methods expose two domesticator callbacks at the
   * interface and are careful to use one for the front and back values and the
   * other for pointers read from the queue itself.  That's not ideal, but it
   * lets the client condition its behavior appropriately and prevents us from
   * accidentally following either of these pointers in generic code.
   * Specifically,
   *
   *   * `domesticate_head` is used for the MPSCQ pointers used to reach into
   *     the chain of objects
   *
   *   * `domesticate_queue` is used to traverse links in that chain (and in
   *     fact, we traverse only the first).
   *
   * In the case that the MPSCQ is not easily accessible to the client,
   * `domesticate_head` can just be a type coersion, and `domesticate_queue`
   * should perform actual validation.  If the MPSCQ is exposed to the
   * allocator client, both Domesticators should perform validation.
