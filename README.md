# snmalloc

snmalloc is a research allocator.  Its key design features are:

* Memory that is freed by the same thread that allocated it does not require any
  synchronising operations.
* Freeing memory in a different thread to initially allocated it, does not take
  any locks and instead uses a novel message passing scheme to return the
  memory to the original allocator, where it is recycled.
* The allocator uses large ranges of pages to reduce the amount of meta-data
  required.

# Building on Windows

The Windows build currently depends on Visual Studio 2017.
To build with Visual Studio:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..
cmake --build . --config Debug
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo
```

You can also omit the last three steps and build from the IDE.
Visual Studio builds use a separate directory to keep the binaries for each
build configuration.

Alternatively, you can follow the steps in the next section to build with Ninja
using the Visual Studio compiler.

# Building on macOS, Linux or FreeBSD
Snmalloc has very few dependencies, CMake, Ninja, Clang 6.0 or later and a C++17
standard library.
Building with GCC is currently not recommended because GCC lacks support for the
`selectany` attribute to specify variables in a COMDAT.  
It will, however, build with GCC-7, but some of global variables will be 
preemptible.

To build a debug configuration:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
ninja
```
To build a release configuration:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja
```
To build with optimizations on, but with debug information:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
ninja
```

On ELF platforms, The build produces a binary `libsnmallocshim.so`.
This file can be 
`LD_PRELOAD`ed to use the allocator in place of the system allocator, for
example, you can run the build script using the snmalloc as the allocator for
your toolchain:

```
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libsnmallocshim.so ninja
```

# CMake Feature Flags

These can be added to your cmake command line.

```
-DUSE_SNMALLOC_STATS=ON // Track allocation stats
-DUSE_MEASURE=ON // Measure performance with histograms
```
